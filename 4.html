        <h2>The Invincibles</h2>
        <p><strong>In May 2002</strong>, Arsenal beat Manchester United to regain the Premier League and equal Preston's record of not losing an away match all season. In assessing the team's achievement, Tim Rich of The Independent wrote: "Invincibles, they called the last team to go through a season unbeaten away from home, although it is a word which belongs far more to the Arsenal side of 2002 than it ever could to the Preston team of 1888-89." Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wanted his team to push on for more honours and described the defeat of Manchester United as a "shift of power" in English football. The team began the following season in good stead; a 4-1 win against Leeds United in September 2002 meant <u>Arsenal broke the domestic record for scoring in consecutive games (47), and away league games without defeat (22).</u> Such was their effective start to the campaign, Wenger reiterated his belief that Arsenal could remain the whole season undefeated.</p>
